            Externalised classpath for deployment specific configuration:
                For a docker deployment, mount the resources into the pre-resources path:
                    volumes:
                      - ./src/main/docker/tomcat/etc/gb-web:/etc/gb-web:ro
                For a workstation deployment, symlink the web app and content resources folders:
                    sudo ln -s /Users/antony/projects/present/gb-web-deployed-runnable/src/test/resources /etc/gb-web
