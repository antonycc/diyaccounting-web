<p>Enter taxi driver receipts against each day in the column for gross takings. Should you wish the taxi driver accounts software to automatically calculate which is the most tax efficient, vehicle running expenses or mileage allowances, cabsmart, then also record the mileage covered in the sales mileage column. Recording mileage is optional in the taxi driver accounts and equally applicable to van drivers and any other similar vehicle based business.</p>
<p>
    <strong>What happens to the bookkeeping information entered?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Cabsmart taxi driver book keeping spreadsheet totals each column for each book keeping month. The totals of each sheet are then collected by the accountancy software to complete the simple book keeping system by automatically producing the <a href="feature.html?feature=TaxiProfitandLossFeature">monthly profit and loss account</a> and taxis <a href="feature.html?feature=TaxiSATaxFeature">self assessment tax return</a> to complete the self employed book keeping system. The taxis sales mileage, if recorded - it is optional - is also automatically transferred to the <a href="feature.html?feature=TaxiExpensesFeature">purchases excel spreadsheet</a> which adds the sales mileage to the purchase mileage and calculates the <a href="feature.html?feature=TaxiProfitandLossFeature">mileage allowances</a>. Mileage allowances are 45p for the first 10,000 miles and 25p thereafter and an alternative to claiming vehicle running costs including <a href="feature.html?feature=ProfitAndLossFeature">vehicle capital allowances</a> on the fixed asset spreadsheet. The Cabsmart taxi book keeping software will automatically claim 45p and change to 25p when applicable, users only have to enter the mileage covered. Cabsmart will then enter the mileage costs on the self assessment tax return if this is the most efficient making your taxi business more profitable.
