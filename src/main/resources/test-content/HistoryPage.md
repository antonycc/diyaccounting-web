<strong>Our Founder's Career History:</strong> </p>
<p>
Having qualified as a Chartered Management
Accountant (ACMA) in 1971, my first assignment as a management accountant being to design the revenue budgeting system
for British Rail, following which I spent two years with New World Gas Cookers initially as Management Accountant, then
Works Accountant, where I also gained my second professional qualification as a Chartered Company Secretary (ACIS).
Following two years and several promotions within British Steel's Audit Division I was appointed Head of Finance and
Administration for the Refractories division. Left to work in Saudi Arabia as a Chief Accountant for an American
corporation and on return to the UK was appointed Chief Accountant at Dunlop Industrial Hose division.
</p>
<p>In the early 1980's I allowed my membership of the professional bodies CIMA and CISA to lapse when I left the accounting
profession and started my own retail and wholesale company buying the first shop with &pound;10k p.a. turnover, within a
few years the business had half a dozen outlets, employees into double figures and sales heading towards that magic
&pound;1 million pound mark.
</p>
<p>
	It wasn't particularly profitable at times and in the early 90's I came back to
accountancy taking numerous assignments across a whole range of finance projects including designing a European sales
accounting system for an international corporation, installing Oracle accounting software modules and a couple of years
developing a treasury management system for a major UK bank.
</p>
<p>Following a four year spell as Finance director for
a communications company I semi-retired in 2000 earning a part-time income from my long term hobby, ornithology,
supplementing my income from several industrial companies preparing their annual financial accounts.
</p>
<p>2006 has
marked yet another career change, DIY Accounting, designing payroll and accounting systems on excel spreadsheets and in
my capacity of a chartered company secretary also as a company formation agent..
</p>
<p>
DIY Accounting software, payroll
software have all been designed by myself. Should you have a question relating to either the accounting software, book
keeping or the payroll software then it will be myself who will personally answer your questions.
</p>
<p>
As a company formation agent, using my experience as a Chartered company secretary deal directly with clients regarding company
formation including writing the company formation memorandum and providing guidance throughout the company formation
sequence.
