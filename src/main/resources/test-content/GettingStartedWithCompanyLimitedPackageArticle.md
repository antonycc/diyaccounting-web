<p>The package is spreadsheet based, so you will need a spreadsheet package to run. If you don&rsquo;t have Microsoft Excel and don&rsquo;t plan to purchase it, you&rsquo;ll need an alternative like OpenOffice which you can download free.</p>
<p>There is a user guide with the package (Companyaccountsuserguide.pdf) which goes into some detail about what to do.</p>
<p>
    In short:
    <br>
    Feed last years profit and loss and balance sheet into Financialaccounts.xlsx &gt; OpenAccounts
    <br>
    Add any outstanding creditors and debtors to Purchases &gt; Opening Creditors and Sales &gt; Opening Debtors
    <br>
    Add the Opening bank balances to the various cash and bank sheets
    <br>
    Ensure the balance sheet balances and all the opening balances reconcile with Open Accounts
    <br>
    Then your off, start feeding in sales, purchases and bank transactions and keep reviewing you position using the financial accounts file.
    <br>
    The files are all linked together so take care not to rename them and if you move the folder around move everything together with Excel closed.
