<p>Adding or deleting rows and columns from the sheets is likely to break the formula.</p>
<p>What you can do is add additional sheets to the same files to do any extract calculations that you need, then copy the values into where they are used.</p>
<p>Some sheets are locked to avoid accidental change but there is no password on most so you can unlock to change row and column labels.</p>
<p>Once you get into changing the structure or formulae your proceeding at your own risk.</p>
<p>If you do this have all the files open so Excel can propagate any changes and take a backup before you start.</p>
