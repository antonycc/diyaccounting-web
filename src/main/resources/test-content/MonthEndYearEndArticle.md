<p>Our Limited Company accounts package is sold by Year End aligned to each Month End. We update the tax rules for each year and a new purchase is required for each accounting period.</p>
<p>Many of our customers are expanding businesses and a recent move from Self Employed to Limited results in confusion between the Accounting Period and the Financial Year End.</p>
<p>A WebCHeck on the Companies House web site will show your accounting reference date. Check this for yourself...</p>

    <li>
        Go here <a href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/">http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/</a>
    </li>
    <li>Select the option to do a "Find Company Information"</li>
    <li>Enter &lt;Your company name&gt; in the company name section</li>
    <li>Click the company number highlighted.</li>
    <li>You will see the following information: &nbsp; Accounting Reference Date: ...</li>

<p>This probably is your Year End unless HMRC have changed it and it hasn't been updated with Companies House yet.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been trading right from the start you&rsquo;ll usually end up with an accounting period that starts on formation, but runs to a month end resulting in more that 12 months for the first year. This is fine with Companies House but HMRC will want 2 returns. You can still use our package and split the year into two but the easiest thing to do, if you haven&rsquo;t been actively trading right away, is to notify HMRC that you didn&rsquo;t start trading right away and have your first accounts running for a period no more than 12 months to the same Year End on the Companies House website.</p>
