The self employed tax accounting package contains a VAT form that is an automated VAT calculator. No manual entries are required as the VAT calculator collects all the sales and purchases from the data entry sheets for the VAT form which has the same box numbers as the standard quarterly VAT returns form.

<p>For non VAT registered business the VAT calculator is still present but dormant when Zero replaces the standard rate (20% in 2013)&nbsp;on the sales and purchase spreadsheet. This enables the Accounting Software to be used by both VAT registered and non VAT registered business and those businesses using a VAT Flat Rate Scheme. To activate the VAT calculator should the VAT threshold be reached and the business becomes VAT registered the change is simple. Enter the VAT rate at the top of the VAT column on the sales sheet when VAT registered and the VAT calculator does the rest.</p>
<p>
    <strong>VAT Flat Rate scheme simply alter the VAT rate on the first sales sheet to the VAT flat rate percentage and the VAT flat rate scheme is then fully operational and automated.</strong>

    <br>
    Businesses with a turnover including VAT of under &pound;150,000 p.a. may adopt a flat rate VAT scheme the VAT rate varying according to the industry.

<p>The VAT threshold at which small businesses must seek a VAT registration usually changes in the budget each March. Currently, for the financial year to 5 April 2008, small businesses that reach the VAT threshold of &pound;67,000 p.a. should register for VAT unless this sales turnover has been exceptional and not likely to be repeated on an ongoing basis.</p>
