<p>Every company which is liable to corporation tax should fill out the Company Tax Return for each accounting period even if you don't owe any corporation tax or are due a refund. If you are due a refund you can choose how this is repaid; either straight away or this can be carried forward to the next accounting year.</p>
<p>If you have received a Corporation Tax refund relating to a previous year, you will follow the below steps:</p>
<p>You would process the actual rebate payment as a negative amount in currentaccount.xls (payments section)</p>
<p>If the Rebate related to a previous years taxation, to make this balance with your corporation tax liability you'll have to make the same adjustment to the corporation tax liability section in financialaccounts &gt; openaccounts.</p>
<p>For example -</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span style="line-height: 1.4285715;">Lets say in your 2011-12 you had a &pound;3000 tax liability and had already paid &pound;2000 towards this before the 2012-13 year started.&nbsp;</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span style="line-height: 1.4285715;">Open accounts would show the &pound;1000 liability.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span style="line-height: 1.4285715;">If later for whatever reason there&nbsp;</span>recalculation<span style="line-height: 1.4285715;">&nbsp;and the 2011-12 liability was reduced from &pound;3000 to &pound;500:</span>
    </li>
    <li>You would be due &pound;1500 back which would be entered in currentaccount &gt; payments (as a negative)</li>
    <li>You would adjust the financialaccounts &gt; open accounts to have a tax liability of -&pound;1500</li>
    <li>Any remaining corporation tax liability would be only from current the 2011-12 year.</li>
</ul>
