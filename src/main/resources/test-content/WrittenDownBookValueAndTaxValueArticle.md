<p>This article explains how to use the Written Down Book Value&nbsp;and Written Down Tax Value columns within the Fixed Assets spread sheet.</p>

# trailingBody
<p>After claiming 50% of the value of the asset in one year the sum of any allowance made in future years should only ever add up to the other 50%.</p>
<p>This is achieved by populating the remaining unclaimed value in column O.</p>
<p>As the asset is unlikely to depreciate by 50% the book value get's out of sync with the tax value.</p>
<p>Example: Asset originally purchased for &pound;1000 Total allowance claimed so far &pound;500 Actual depreciation &pound;100</p>
<ul>
    <li>Written Down Book Value: &pound;900 (&pound;1000-&pound;100)</li>
    <li>Written Down Tax Value: &pound;500</li>
</ul>
