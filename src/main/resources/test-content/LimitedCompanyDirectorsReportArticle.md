    Sample directors report required when the company director submits the company year end accounts to HMRC requiring a limited company directors report
    <br>
     
    <br>
    The company accounts year end reports to HMRC and Companies House are different for small private limited companies. Companies House accept abbreviated year end accounts including a profit statement and balance sheet with notes and statutory statements.
    <br>
     
    <br>
    HMRC receive the same year end documents plus the corporation tax calculation, <a href="feature.html?feature=TaxandAssetsFeature">CT600 corporation tax return</a>. Also since HMRC require more detailed information to verify the net taxable profit they require more detailed expenditure analysis in the company profit statement and also expect a limited company directors report with the year end accounts.
    <br>
     
    <br>
    Below is a typical limited company directors report to be included as part of the year end reports in the final <a href="feature.html?feature=YearEndAccountsFeature">year end accounts</a> submitted to HMRC. Details in the report can be expanded as required by the directors. If you wish to use this sample directors report then download a free copy here
