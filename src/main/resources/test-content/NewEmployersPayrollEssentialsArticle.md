    <strong>PAYE and Payroll Records</strong>
    <br>
    Accurate payroll records are essential, full stop. Employers must keep payroll records for both HMRC&nbsp;purposes and employees. The employee records must include the name and address of the employee, national insurance number, date of birth, income tax code, all payments and benefits made and all deductions for income tax, national insurance and voluntary deductions.
    <br>
    When registering to operate a PAYE system immediate arrangements should be made to ensure these records are maintained either by setting up the records yourself using the help and advice contained in the Revenue CD-ROM provided to all new and existing employers or employing a payroll service to produce the records or using a payroll software package.
    <br>
    Various payroll software packages are available with different degrees of complexity. The DIY Accounting Payroll Software is an ideal solution for small employers being written on excel spreadsheets and in addition to producing the deduction calculations and payslips the payroll software also automatically completes an excel copy of the compulsory HMRC forms significantly easing the administrative burden.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Paying Employees</strong>
    <br>
    Employees must be paid the national minimum wage which for adults was raised on the 1st October 2007 to &pound;5.52 per hour. Every employee must receive a payslip that shows the amount of income tax and national insurance deducted from the gross pay. In addition every employer must also calculate the employer&rsquo;s national insurance contribution. If you are an employer and not operating a payroll software system such as the DIY Accounting Payroll Software then you must design a payslip to give to your employees to satisfy legal requirements.
