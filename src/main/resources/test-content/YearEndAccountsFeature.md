    The end product produced by the DIY Accounting company accounts package is not simply a set of financial accounts to be sent to the accountant but a full set of limited company accounts ready for publication and submission to Companies House and the Inland Revenue.
    <br>
     
    <br>
    A fully automated set of limited company accounts is produced from the basic sales income and purchase expenses entered in the spreadsheets. The final accounts shown below as an example is an abbreviated copy of the final profit and loss account, balance sheet and notes to the accounts which include the statutory Companies Act statements required when submitting the published financial accounts to Companies House .
    <br>
     
    <br>
    Accounting knowledge is not required to produce the company accounts as the formulae and linking structure within the excel spreadsheets have automated the accounting function including the double entry bookkeeping that is used to prepare the accounts. The client work stops at the point where sales and expenses are input into the spreadsheets from where the accounting software automatically produces a trial balance and then goes the extra step by using those figures to produce the year end accounts, annual profit and loss account and balance sheet. and corporation tax calculation plus an accounting spreadsheet containing the CT600 corporation tax return.

<p>Production of the balance sheet is undoubtedly a technical accounting function which has been fully automated to produce not just the list of fixed and current assets and liabilities, debtor and creditor balances but is automatically balanced too as the bookkeeping financial transactions are only required to be entered once in the data entry accounting spreadsheets and the accounting software uses each of the financial transactions twice to complete the accounting entries.&nbsp;</p>

    <strong>Notes to the company accounts</strong>
    <br>
    The notes to the company accounts package include a number of statements required under the Companies Act which are pre-printed into the final year end accounts that the accounting software produces.
    <br>
     
    <br>
     Abbreviated copies of the final set of year end company accounts for publication and submission to Companies House and HMRC. The actual final accounts for publication contain the statutory notes and a detailed automated corporation tax calculation that together with the CT600 HMRC corporation tax return provide the actual full set of accounts required for submission to the Inland Revenue.
