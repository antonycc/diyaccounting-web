<h2>Alastair</h2>
    <p>"We launched our Limited Company three years ago, specialising in the supply of toothbrushes and toothbrush storage systems to schools and nurseries. &nbsp;After reading lots of favourable reviews, we opted for the DIY Accounting package for our accounts and I am delighted that we did.</p>
<p>I had no previous experience of accounting but have been able to prepare all our accounts, VAT returns, Corporation tax returns etc without seeking the assistance of an accountant. &nbsp;We enter our sales on the 'Sales' spreadsheet, our purchases on the 'Purchases' spreadsheet and the DIY accounting package collates all the information automatically and prepares a full set of accounts for our business with minimal additional input. &nbsp;On the odd occasion when we have had a problem, I have found that DIY accounting provides excellent and prompt support. &nbsp;They are always just an email away and I would heartily commend this package."</p>

<h2>Angie</h2>
    <p>&ldquo;I have used DIY Accounting for all our accounts for the last 5 years.&nbsp; From Sole Trader to the Limited Company that we now are, I have found DIY Accounting Products amazingly easy to use (especially for the non-accountant), with an excellent &ldquo;How to&rdquo; manual.&nbsp; However, the best part of DIY Accounting is their customer service.&nbsp; Their founder, Terry Cartwright offered the same incredible level of service and I am delighted that this has continued on &ndash; he would be really proud.&nbsp; DIY Accounting are simply THE BEST!&rdquo;</p>

    &ldquo;<span style="line-height: 1.4285715;">I have to say that the level of customer support provided is beyond exceptional</span>
</p>
<p>
    <br>
    The spreadsheets are very easy to use even for someone with no accountancy training. But a couple of days prior to filing our CT600 we noticed a couple of balancing errors that we just couldn&rsquo;t seem to resolve. After emailing their support team we sent them the files and within a few hours all was fixed, balanced and ready to submit &ndash; No extra fees charged, just part of their exceptional customer service. Thank you<span style="line-height: 1.4285715;">&rdquo;</span>

    <p>
    &ldquo;<span style="line-height: 1.4285715;">Having produced spreadsheets for my accountant during the financial year, I hit upon hard times with people going out of business owing me money.&nbsp; This gave me a terrible cashflow problem which I concentrated on and at the end of the financial year decided the accountants fees were just too high for such a small business.&nbsp; I found DIY Accounting on the internet and decided to "do it myself".&nbsp; I had experience of looking at P&amp;L and Balance Sheets and experience in inputting accounts but not completing the whole process.&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<div>I had problems reconciling everything and asked DIY for help, they were fabulous!&nbsp; I had caused problems in the spreadsheets and info was not pulling across correctly and Louise sorted through this for me and put everything right.&nbsp; I can't praise them enough, too many small businesses pay the astronomical prices for accountants when they can do it themselves with the DIY Accounting package.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
    I highly recommend them to all small businesses!!<span style="line-height: 1.4285715;">&rdquo;</span>

    "[DIY Accounting]&nbsp;&nbsp;is a fantastic system. One I will be recommending to people.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(42,42,42);">DIY Accounting is a fantastic tool. I have to wonder why I have spent &pound;1,000s on accountants to do my end of year accounts when DIY Accounting is around. I do not have any financial qualifications and this system is simple to understand. Amazing value for money."</span>

    <p>&ldquo;Wow! What a great service! I am impressed!</p>
<p>My accountant let me down completely [hidden name]&nbsp;went bust, then he promised to do the work himself but he didn't. I bought your brilliant package last year, but I was unsure about the whole idea of doing it myself and did not realise that you do the check-in service, which is outstanding.</p>
<p>I feel I am learning something new and it gives me a lot of satisfaction, too.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Sandplay</h2>
    <p>I have used the DIY Accounting package for 6 years to manage my small Limited company accounts.&nbsp; I find it easy to use and have learned the basics of financial accounting.&nbsp; The business cannot afford to employ an Accountant so the package is ideal to comply with the legal requirements of running a small business, such as Profit &amp; Loss, Balance Sheets and assisting with Tax Returns.</p>

    <span style="color: rgb(42,42,42);">"DIY accountancy software is so simple to use. If you run a small company you can save up to &pound;4,000 a year, that&rsquo;s what some accountants charge for few pages of paperwork. I have been using this software for a few years now and if I had any questions, I receive the answer in a very short time from Antony, who is very supportive and expert at this software. Its worth a try and once you know this software you wont regret it and you will definitely become a returning costumer."</span>
