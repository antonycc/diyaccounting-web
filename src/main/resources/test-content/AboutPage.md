Self-made spreadsheets by the father and founder of DIY Accounting, Terry Cartwright (our dad) made a name for the
company by its ease of use and the personal customer service. Often missed by our competitors.

Carrying on his work are Antony Cartwright (managing director), Jane Grundy (corporate director), Samantha Cartwright
(customer services director) and myself, Lindsey Cartwright, whose chief responsibility is to keep up the good name of
DIY Accounting.

<strong>Current History</strong>
</p>
<p>
Since taking over the day to day running of DIY Accounting in January 2010 it has been a very busy time for Antony, Jane,
Samantha and Lindsey who have performed a variety of roles with the aim of building the business.&nbsp;Antony has taken
time out of his role as an IT consultant to become the hands-on Managing Director, Lindsey became our dedicated Marketing
Executive while Samantha remains our customer service director and your first point on contact for sales and queries.
</p>
<p>Since the start of 2012 we have been getting more outside help from an online marketing consultant to help get our
website ready for the big launch (we hope you like it!) and an accounts assistant to provide further accounting support
for all your technical queries.

<strong>Our Founder's Career History:</strong>
</p>
<p>Having qualified as a Chartered Management Accountant (ACMA) in 1971, my first assignment as a management
accountant being to design the revenue budgeting system for British Rail, following which I spent two years with New
World Gas Cookers initially as Management Accountant, then Works Accountant, where I also gained my second professional
qualification as a Chartered Company Secretary (ACIS). Following two years and several promotions within British Steel's
Audit Division I was appointed Head of Finance and Administration for the Refractories division. Left to work in Saudi
Arabia as a Chief Accountant for an American corporation and on return to the UK was appointed Chief Accountant at
Dunlop Industrial Hose division.
</p>
<p>
In the early 1980's I allowed my membership of the professional bodies CIMA and
CISA to lapse when I left the accounting profession and started my own retail and wholesale company buying the first
shop with &pound;10k p.a. turnover, within a few years the business had half a dozen outlets, employees into double
figures and sales heading towards that magic &pound;1 million pound mark.
</p>
<p>
It wasn't particularly profitable at
times and in the early 90's I came back to accountancy taking numerous assignments across a whole range of finance
projects including designing a European sales accounting system for an international corporation, installing Oracle
accounting software modules and a couple of years developing a treasury management system for a major UK bank.
</p>
<p>
Following a four year spell as Finance director for a communications company I semi-retired in 2000 earning a
part-time income from my long term hobby, ornithology, supplementing my income from several industrial companies
preparing their annual financial accounts.
</p>
<p>
2006 has marked yet another career change, DIY Accounting, designing
payroll and accounting systems on excel spreadsheets and in my capacity of a chartered company secretary also as a
company formation agent.
</p>
<p>
DIY Accounting software, payroll software have all been designed by myself. Should you
have a question relating to either the accounting software, book keeping or the payroll software then it will be myself
who will personally answer your questions.
</p>
<p>
As a company formation agent, using my experience as a Chartered
company secretary deal directly with clients regarding company formation including writing the company formation
memorandum and providing guidance throughout the company formation sequence.
