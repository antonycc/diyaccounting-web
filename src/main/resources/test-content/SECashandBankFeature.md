    <strong>Self employed accounting spreadsheets format for bank cash accounts</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <br>
    The self employed accounts contains both a cash account spreadsheet and a business bank account spreadsheet to account for cash and bank transactions. With the exception of bank interest and bank account charges the cash and bank spreadsheets account for the movement in money being amounts received from customers and payments to suppliers not actual sales or expenses. Sales turnover and purchase expenses are accounted for when included in the sales and purchases accounting spreadsheets.
    <br>

    <strong>HMRC and Business Bank Account</strong>
    <br>
    <strong>&nbsp;</strong>
    <br>
    A self employed business does not have to operate a business bank account and can use a personal bank account as both accounts are personal to the business owner being of self employed status. Maintaining a separate business bank account has advantages in keeping personal finances separate from business finances with regard to financial control.
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    HMRC requirements for <a href="product.html?product=BasicSoleTraderProduct">sole trader</a> and <a href="product.html?product=SelfEmployedProduct">self employed</a> accounts are that financial records and documents such as sales invoices, receipts and purchase invoices should be retained as third party evidence to support the financial accounts. If a business bank account is used HMRC would regard the bank transactions as part of the supporting information and expect the business to keep proper records of say the business current account and might ask to see those records during an enquiry.
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    A personal bank account used for some business transactions is slightly different. While during an enquiry HMRC might request sight of the personal bank account they do not have a statutory right to do so.

    <strong>DIY Accounting Self employed Bank Account Spreadsheets</strong>
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    The <a href="product.html?product=SelfEmployedProduct">self employed accounts</a> contain a cash account spreadsheet and a bank account spreadsheet. If the business runs a business bank account then the self employed accounts would be the appropriate choice.
    <br>
    &nbsp;
    <br>
    The basic <a href="product.html?product=BasicSoleTraderProduct">sole trader accounts</a> do not contain an accounting spreadsheet for cash bank accounts and is therefore more suitable for self employed business that use personal accounts rather than dedicated business bank accounts.

    <strong>BANK ACCOUNT RECEIPTS</strong>

<p>

<p>
    <strong>BANK ACCOUNT PAYMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p>Analysis of the bank statement provides financial control and allows banking expense entries and drawings to be entered which are then automated and included in the monthly profit and loss account. Drawings are collected by the Monthly Profit &amp; Loss account as part of the Financial Health Check</p>

</p>
<p>Enter the bank account debits on the left side of the bank current account sheet and the bank account credits on the right hand side. Easiest way is to copy the entries from the bank statement to ensure the bank account is the same as the bank statement whose balance is also entered to complete the bank reconciliation.</p>
<p>
    <strong>POSTING CASH ACCOUNT</strong>
</p>
<p>The Cash account spreadsheet is also provided. Posting cash entries is optional and in the same format as the Bank current account spreadsheet. Retailers who typically receive sales income in cash would use the cash account to post the cash received and show cash out when banked to maintain solid accounting records. Many self employed businesses may not need a cash reconciliation but will often withdraw cash from the bank current account to pay for petty cash transactions. Enter the expenses in purchases and the cash account format to account for the payments.</p>
<p>The excel book keeping spreadsheets were designed from the simple small business bookkeeping software used for existing clients to make financial transactions fast, easy to enter and understand. Formula driven so that minimum data is entered with automated analysis producing from the book keeping system. Accountancy software reduced to its simplest form of single entry.</p>
<p>
    <strong>BANK ACCOUNT RECONCILIATION</strong>
</p>
<p>Automated from the entries made to the bank account format, simply enter the bank current account statement balance each month and the Bank spreadsheet does the bank reconciliation automatically to ensure the total of any missed items are highlighted</p>

</p>
<p>
    <em><strong>What happens to the Current Bank and Cash account information entered?</strong></em>
</p>
<p>
    The bank account format accounts spreadsheet totals each column for each book keeping month. The totals of each cash account and the bank current account spreadsheet are then collected by the accountancy software to complete the simple book keeping system by automatically producing the monthly <a href="feature.html?feature=SEProfitandLossFeature">profit and loss account</a>&nbsp;and <a href="feature.html?feature=SelfAssessmentFeature">self assessment tax return</a> to complete the self employed book keeping system.
</p>
<p>The user guide that accompanies this self employed book keeping system has notes on bank cash accounts spreadsheets to assist a comprehensive Accounting Software package to be completed with ease and maintain full financial control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accountancy software designed to save many times the cost of buying it.</p>
