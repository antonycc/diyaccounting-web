<p>There are DIY Accounting Limited Company packages for each month end.</p>
<p>For the first year many companies have more than a 12 month accounting period.</p>
<p>Depending on how much over 12 months the first year is and whether trading started right away you may need to file 2 returns to HMRC and 1 to Companies House.</p>
<p>The easiest thing to do would to inform HMRC you didn't start trading right away and have a 12 month return.</p>
<p>Which ever way it is, you'll need to start will all your transactions in the same place to have a full view of the first period.</p>
<p>Initially take the product that matches your year end and put the first&nbsp;transactions in the first month's sheet even if they actually fell in an earlier month.</p>
<p>Companies House will probably want a return for the whole period whereas HMRC will want one return of a maximum of 12 months and another shorter one.</p>
<p>When you find out how they want to split things up (notice to complete CT600 from HMRC) you can check you&rsquo;ve still got a package with the right year end for the larger period in the split then carry on.</p>
<p>When you come to file use HMRC&rsquo;s online filing PDF (which also submits to Companies House for you) download a copy for the date range covering everything Companies House want, complete the form fully to run your figures through the validation rules but don&rsquo;t submit yet.</p>
<p>Next the painful first year only bit... You&rsquo;ll need to split your accounts into two sets one for the earlier period and one for the later.</p>
<p>Do this by making two copies of the full set and zero/blank out the overlapping transactions (zero/blank out don't delete rows).</p>
<p>You'll need to take the closing figures from the first set and enter these in "Open Accounts" for the second set.</p>
<p>When that&rsquo;s done check the year end figures in the split set match the end figures in the full set your are ready to file: &nbsp;&nbsp; The full period to Companies House &nbsp;&nbsp; Both short periods to HMRC</p>
