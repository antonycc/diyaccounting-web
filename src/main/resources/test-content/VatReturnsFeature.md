    <strong>COMPANY ACCOUNTS PACKAGE VALUE ADDED TAX (VAT)</strong>
</p>
<p>Company Accounts package is for limited liability companies that are both VAT and non Vat registered.</p>
<p>No vat will be collected on these automated vat returns when Zero replaces the standard rate (20% in 2013)&nbsp;on the sales and purchase spreadsheet. This enables the Accounting Software to be used by both vat registered and non vat registered business and those businesses using a Vat Flat Rate Scheme.</p>
<p>VAT Flat Rate scheme simply alter the vat rate on the first sales sheet to the flat rate percentage and the vat flat rate scheme is then fully operational and automated.</p>
<p>This is the actual note contained in the user guide that accompanies all packages purchased:</p>
<p>
    <strong>CHANGE REQUIRED IF VAT FLAT RATE REGISTERED</strong>
    <br>
    Businesses with a turnover including VAT of under &pound;150,000 p.a. may adopt a flat rate vat scheme the rate varying according to the industry.
    <br>
    When a flat rate scheme is adopted invoice sales including the standard vat rate as applicable.
    <br>
    Also change the vat calculation throughout the accounting system by entering the vat flat rate just once as follows:
    <br>
    Go to <strong>Sales Spreadsheet</strong> Column H Row 4 Cell H4 (this cell is shaded light blue)
    <br>
    Enter the FLAT RATE PERCENTAGE
    <br>
    This entry to the sales spreadsheets are then automatically carried forward to the remaining months effectively changing the collection of vat from the standard rate to the Flat Rate percentage.
    <br>
    In addition it shows sales turnover net of the flat rate percentage and accounts for all purchases including vat input as a business expense on the aut5omated vat return..
    <br>

<p>The VAT threshold at which small businesses must seek a VAT registration usually changes in the budget each March. The VAT threshold of from 1st April 2017 is &pound;85,000 p.a. Companies should register for VAT unless this sales turnover has been exceptional and not likely to be repeated on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>Businesses should note the legal position regarding VAT that under the customs rules any business whose sales exceed the VAT threshold are liable to pay vat at the standard rate (20% in 2013)&nbsp;on their sales turnover whether they register with HM Revenue &amp; Customs for VAT or not.</p>
