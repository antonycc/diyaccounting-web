</p>
<p>
    <strong>FIXED ASSETS AND CAPITAL TAX ALLOWANCES</strong>
</p>
<p>Fixed items are physical items used by the business over a period of more than one year.</p>
<p>Depreciation spreads the financial effect on profits over the life of the fixed asset but does not have an effect on the business tax as depreciation is disallowed as an expense. Instead the business receives a capital tax allowance on the cost of fixed assets, taxis to set against profit.</p>
<p>When the fixed asset schedule is completed the capital allowances are automatically calculated and also update the profit and loss account in the depreciation column. While depreciation is then disallowed in the self assessment tax return the same amount is then added back to the expenses as capital allowances. Capital allowances on taxis are automatically reduced by the personal use %.</p>
<p>For the financial year 6 April 2007&ndash; 5 April 2008 50% of the cost of the vans can be set off against profits in the year purchased which is called First Year Allowance. The remaining value of the asset is then written off against future years profits at 25% of the book value remaining. The taxi driver accounts software has these percentages already written into the taxi book keeping software with taxis being able to claim a 25% writing down allowance each year.</p>
<p>Businesses should set a consistent policy in the treatment of fixed assets and it is suggested that only long term assets (used more than one year) and costing over &pound;100 should be classified as &ldquo;fixed&rdquo;</p>
