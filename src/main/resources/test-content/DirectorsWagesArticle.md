<p>As a Director and 100% Shareholder you can take drawings out of the business, either as Dividends (which attract capital gains tax) or as a Salary (which is PAYE).</p>
<p>The dividends are a drawing on profits (or reserves) by shareholders. This is separate from the director's remuneration.</p>
<p>An entry is made in the company secretary file for the dividend amount agreed for the year and the actual payment (or payments) are recorded in currentaccounts.xls.</p>
<p>Your tax liability will be a personal tax liability you pay when sending your accounts in to HMRC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you pay yourself a Salary and are a Director of the business these costs are part of the administration cost for the company and appear as "director's remuneration" in the Profit and Loss.</p>
<p>You can use HMRC's Payroll to enter the monthly Salary into the system and then direct into the package using the Wages Interface sheet.</p>
