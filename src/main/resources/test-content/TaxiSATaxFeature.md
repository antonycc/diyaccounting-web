</p>
<p>
    The short tax return is completed for the financial year 2007-08 if sales turnover was under the vat threshold limit of &pound;64,000. If turnover exceed the vat threshold then the taxi driver would need to be vat registered and also complete the full tax return. In those circumstances the <a href="product.html?product=SelfEmployedProduct">self employed package</a> would be a better option as the self employed accounts completes either the short tax return or the <a href="feature.html?feature=SelfAssessmentFeature">full tax return </a>as appropriate.
</p>
<p>The taxi accounting package works as the taxi accountant by automatically completing the tax return. If the taxi receipts were under &pound;30,000 then the details required in the short tax return are reduced to the sales turnover and total expenses. If taxi receipts exceed the &pound;30,000 further expenses analysis is required as shown in the section below.</p>
<p>The taxi accounts automatically changes to complete the full analysis when required. No special action is required by the taxi driver as the taxi accounting automatically collects the correct figures from the taxi accounts spreadsheets</p>
<p>
    Specific to a taxi driver the vehicle running costs are included in the cost of sales section as vehicle costs are the main items purchased which are effectively resold to taxi passengers and the <a href="product.html?product=TaxiDriverProduct">taxi driver accounts </a>should be arranged in this format.

    <strong>Inland revenue SELF EMPLOYED tax return section 3</strong>
</p>
<p>The capital allowances section of the self employed tax return form is the most difficult for taxi drivers who are not conversant with the tax system. Completing the short tax return requires the cab driver to understand capital allowances that can be claimed against taxis and mini cabs.</p>
<p>For taxis the first year allowance was 50%, 2007-08 and in subsequent years the writing down allowance is 25% of the balance. For tax year 2008-09 the annual investment allowance of 100% can be claimed if the taxi vehicle is a commercial vehicle such as a hackney carriage. Private hire drivers, cab and mini cab drivers would normally use a private vehicle and the writing down allowance available for non commercial vehicles is 20% restricted to a maximum allowance of &pound;3,000</p>
<p>Special rules apply to vehicles and of particular interest when preparing the taxi driver accounts. These special rules certainly affect taxi drivers many of whom will find they are not eligible to claim the 50% first year allowance on their taxi. The first year allowance applies to commercial vehicles such as hackney cabs but not to cars used for taxi business.</p>
<p>Section 3 is the tax accountant nature of the taxi drivers package excels automatically completing the capital allowances from the fixed asset schedule which has all the capital allowance rates embedded.</p>
