<p>The tax written down value is the price paid less the capital allowances whereas the written down book value is the price paid less depreciation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use any depreciation rate you like for an asset but the HMRC prescribes specific capital allowance percentages.</p>
<p>Try this example (entering it into the Year End 2012 accounts):</p>
<p>A machine was bought in 10th April 2010 for &pound;1000 and has deprecated by &pound;100 before the April 2011. It continues to depreciate at 10% per year. The written down value on 6th April 2011 is &pound;900 (matching the depreciation)</p>
<p>Enter:</p>
<ol>
    <li>B14: 10/04/2010</li>
    <li>V14: A Machine</li>
    <li>E14: 1000</li>
    <li>F10: 100</li>
    <li>O14: 900</li>
</ol>
<p>A written down value of &pound;720 is calculated for the end of 2012,</p>
<p>Columns W through Z remain blank.</p>
<p>The machine is sold on the 1st August 2012 for &pound;500.</p>
<p>Enter:</p>
<ol>
    <li>U14: 01/08/2010</li>
    <li>V14: 500&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>As soon as the 500 is entered columns W through Z, including Y are calculated.</p>
<p>Selling below the written down value is a loss bringing in more to claim for a Capital Allowance &pound;220 in this case.</p>
