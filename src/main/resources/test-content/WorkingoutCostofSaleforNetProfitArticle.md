<p>It's important to calculate the "cost of sale" figure in any business in order to work out the net profit and therefore provide an analysis of how the business is really doing.</p>
<p>
    Firstly, lets identify what these terms really mean. The <em>cost of sale</em> figure, for example, is defined as the wholesale cost of the product sold.
</p>
<p>
    The&nbsp;<em>cost of sale</em>&nbsp;figure&nbsp;is found by finding total <em>income</em> minus the <em>cost of goods sold</em>. <em>Cost of goods sold</em> can be found by adding the <em>purchases</em> to the<em> starting stock</em> and subtracting the<em> finishing stock.</em>
</p>
<p>
    The <em>gross profit</em> is found by using the <em>income</em> less the <em>cost of sale</em>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Working out cost of sale for <em>net profit</em> can be worked out by subtracting the <em>admin costs</em> from the <em>gross profit.</em>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Working out the Cost of Sale figure to calculate your Net Profit:</p>
<p>Cost of Sale = (Purchases + Starting stock) - Finishing stock</p>
<p>
    <span style="line-height: 1.4285715;">Gross Profit = Income - Cost of Sale</span>
</p>
<p>Net profit = Gross profit - Admin costs</p>
<p>Example -&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Stock increasing: &nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.4285715;">&pound;30,000 + (&pound;20,000 - &pound;10,000) - &pound;10,000 = &pound;30,000 profit</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        Stock the same: &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.4285715;">&pound;30,000 + (&pound;10,000 - &pound;10,000) - &pound;10,000 = &pound;20,000 profit&nbsp;</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span style="line-height: 1.4285715;">Stock decreasing:&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.4285715;">&pound;30,000 + (&pound;10,000 - &pound;20,000) - &pound;10,000 = &pound;10,000 profit</span>
    </li>
</ul>
