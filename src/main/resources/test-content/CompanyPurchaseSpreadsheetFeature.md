A solution for a simple book keeping system with notes in the book keeping system user guide as to what items should be analysed to which columns.</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>What happens to the bookkeeping information entered?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The above excel book keeping spreadsheet totals each column for each book keeping month. The totals of each sheet are then collected by the accountancy software to complete the simple book keeping system by automatically producing the <a href="feature.html?feature=VatReturnsFeature">vat returns</a> each quarter, monthly profit and loss account. The purchase mileage, if recorded - it is optional - is also automatically adds in the sales mileage to the purchase mileage and calculates the mileage allowance. Mileage allowances are 45p for the first 10,000 miles and 25p thereafter and an alternative to claiming vehicle running costs including vehicle capital allowances on the fixed asset spreadsheet. This accountancy software will automatically claim 45p and change to 25p when applicable, users only have to enter the mileage covered.
</p>
<p>The user guide that accompanies this limited company book keeping system has notes on mileage allowances and other tax tips to help save you money including household expenses that can be claimed and dealing with partner costs , tax saving tips that will be lost unless you follow the revenue ground rules carefully but will save self employed sole traders money .</p>
<p>Accountancy software designed to save many times the cost of buying it.</p>
<p>A simple bookkeeping system so clients can spend time saving money, not wasting it on unnecessarily complex accountancy software.</p>
<p>
    <strong>FIXED ASSETS AND CAPITAL TAX ALLOWANCES</strong>
</p>
<p>Fixed items are physical items used by the business over a period of more than one year.</p>
<p>Depreciation spreads the financial effect on profits over the life of the fixed asset but does not have an effect on the business tax as depreciation is disallowed as an expense. Instead the business receives a capital tax allowance on the cost of fixed assets to set against its profit.</p>
<p>When the fixed asset schedule is completed the capital allowances are automatically calculated and also update the profit and loss account in the depreciation column. While depreciation is then disallowed in the self assessment tax return the same amount is then added back to the expenses as capital allowances. Capital allowances on vehicles are automatically reduced by the personal use %.</p>
<p>For the financial year 6 April 2008 &ndash; 5 April 2009 50% of the cost of the asset can be set off against profits in the year purchased which is called First Year Allowance. The remaining value of the asset is then written off against future years profits at 25% of the book value remaining. The accountancy software has these percentages already written into the book keeping system. Residual net book values for tax purposes can after 1st April 2008 be written off immediately.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Businesses should set a consistent policy in the treatment of fixed assets and it is suggested that only long term assets (used more than one year) and costing over &pound;100 should be classified as &ldquo;fixed&rdquo;</p>
