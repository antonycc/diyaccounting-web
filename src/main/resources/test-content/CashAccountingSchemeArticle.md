    <span style="line-height: 1.4285715;">To use DIY Accounting package with a Cash Accounting scheme rather than the normal Double Entry scheme, only enter the values in Sales and Purchases when the transaction actually clears and use the cleared transaction date. </span>

    <span style="line-height: 1.4285715;">For a Cash Accounting scheme the information in Sales and Purchase would match the transactions in Cash...xls and Bank...xsl.</span>
</p>
<p>(The easiest way I find to do this is to enter Sales and Purchases when reconciling against a monthly bank statement.)</p>
