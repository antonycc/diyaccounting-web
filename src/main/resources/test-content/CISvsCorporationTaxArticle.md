    <span style="line-height: 1.4285715;">To record Income received as a Sub Contractor, you would input the following:</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span style="line-height: 1.4285715;">Example - Income of</span><span style="line-height: 1.4285715;">&nbsp;&pound;1000 gross and 20% CIS was deducted by the contractor (&pound;200.00) so the net amount received was &pound;800,&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p>In Sales, enter the amount of gross income (&pound;1000) and the CIS deducted (&pound;200) in the CIS column on the same row.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In current account enter the amount actually received from the debtor (main contractor) &pound;800.00</p>
<p>
    In the cash account payments section make 2 entries:
    <br>
    &bull; A payment to CIS of -&pound;200 (minus 200) using code RC
    <br>
    &bull; A payment of Corporation Tax of &pound;200 using code RT
</p>
<p>This "journal entry" is cash neutral and just moves the liability from one account to the other.</p>
<p>Your corporation tax calculation remains the same, but the liability in the balance sheet reduces.</p>
