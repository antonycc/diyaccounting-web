<p>
    Support is available by contacting VitalTax directly on their <a href="https://vitaltax.uk/#contact-form">website</a>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Why have DIY Accounting not developed their own solution?</strong>
</p>
<p>This is something we considered but, to ensure something was ready for April 2019 we decided to collaborate with a small business which already had created a solution.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Are there any more videos I can watch?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Yes, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OpkmJEHPag">this one </a>is a bit longer and not designed for DIY Accounting but gives a general idea of how it all works.&nbsp; <span style="color: rgb(0,128,128);"><strong>Happy Watching!</strong></span>
