<p>The final deadline date for submitting the inland revenue self assessment tax return is 31st January following the end of the tax year on 5 April. Income tax and national insurance due must also be paid by 31st January.</p>

<p>The capital allowances section of the self assessment tax return form is the most difficult for people who are self employed and not conversant with at least a minimum knowledge of accounting and the tax system. Completing the self assessment tax return requires the self employed businessman to understand the tax system as applied to capital allowances that can be claimed against fixed assets.</p>
<p>While a potential difficult area for the non accountant capital allowances reduce the net tax payable. The difficulty in this section of the tax return form is that it is an area which many start up businesses may not have come across before. It is an area which affects not just the calculation of the tax allowances and knowledge of the tax rates but also how an item becomes considered for such tax allowances.</p>
<p>Also on page 1 of the supplementary self assessment pages are boxes to enter the sales turnover, total expenses and net taxable profit for small business with a sales turnover including the total of the capital allowances is under &pound;15,000. If turnover is over this lower threshold then a more detailed analysis of income and expenditure is required on page 2.</p>

<p>Accurate accounting records are required to complete the self assessment return with income and expenditure of different types being entered against specific box numbers in the income and expenditure section of the self assessment tax return form.</p>
<p>When turnover exceeds 15,000 pounds totals are required of the sales and business income and then deducted from that total the cost of sales which is split into three categories of expense. Cost of sales is the direct costs of purchases which are resold, these purchases usually being physical materials but should also include any services which are bought for resale.</p>
<p>The remaining and main body of the inland revenue self assessment tax return form concerns an analysis of the expenses. The majority of the expense categories are self explanatory in the title. Additional expense analysis other than the prescribed headings on the self assessment tax return is unnecessary for the vast majority of self employed business.</p>
