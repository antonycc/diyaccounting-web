<p>DIY Accounting is spreadsheet based, you have three options for running it on a Mac. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In order of cost: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
    <li>Install OpenOffice then download the Excel 2003 or OpenOffice version from the DIY download page. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Install Office for Mac (retail software from Microsoft) and use the Excel version of DIY Accounting &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Install Windows Parallels (or similar Virtual Machine) and MS Office on your Mac use then Excel version of DIY Accounting &nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>The cost of the Microsoft options is likely to be prohibitive if you only need Excel to run DIY Accounting.</p>
<p>The last two options are more suitable for people who run Microsoft software already.</p>
<p>
    OpenOffice is a free alternative to MS Office (and other commercial products) and it works on a Mac. OpenOffice is available from here here: <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">http://www.openoffice.org/</a>. That said the best experience is obtained by using the package with Excel 2007 or above. You should also be able to use LibreOffice (<a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/">http://www.libreoffice.org/</a>) which is a variant of OpenOffice maintained by a separate team.
</p>
<p>
    After purchase, when you visit your download page there is an option to download a zip file which will require unzipping after download. Some Macs have an unzip utility built in, if not here is a free tool that seems to get most mentions on a search: <a href="http://www.stuffit.com/mac-expander.html#compare">http://www.stuffit.com/mac-expander.html#compare</a>
