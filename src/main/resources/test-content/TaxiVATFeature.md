    <a href="product.html?product=TaxiDriverProduct">DIY Accounting Cabsmart</a> accounting package is for self employed taxi &amp; van drivers that are <strong>NOT VAT REGISTERED</strong>.
</p>
<p>If you are registered for vat please visit DIY Accounting Self Employed which would be more suitable accounting packages. These packages do not compare vehicle running costs with mileage allowances as they are not specifically designed for taxi &amp; van drivers but for general business activities.</p>

</p>
<p>If a sole trader is not vat registered then output value added tax is not added to the sales made and input value added tax cannot be claimed on purchases.</p>
<p>Quarterly vat returns do not have to be made and the self employed small business does not have to register with HM Revenue &amp; Customs for vat purposes.</p>
<p>The vat threshold at which small businesses must seek a vat registration usually changes in the budget each March.</p>
<p>The vat threshold for small businesses was increased to &pound;68,000 p.a. with effect from 1 May 2009 Sole traders with turnover that reaches the vat threshold should register for vat unless this sales turnover has been exceptional and not likely to be repeated on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>Sole traders should note the legal position regarding vat that under the customs rules any business whose sales exceed the vat threshold, currently &pound;68,000 p.a., are liable to pay vat at the standard vat rate on their sales turnover whether they register with HM Revenue &amp; Customs for vat or not.</p>
